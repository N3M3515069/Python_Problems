# python-practice-problems-from-codewars
This was my 4th successful kyu-6 kata from codeawars , all I ahd to do here was count the number of characters occuring in a string and create a dictionary out of it.
Learnt about two new dictionary methods via this kata which were .setdefault() and .fromkeys()
